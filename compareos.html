    <h2>Windows 10<h2\>
    <p>has multiple users can run all programs that weren't made specifically for macOS works well with all versions of software it comes pre installed with CMD and powershell as its command prompts as well its default web browser is internet explorer<p>
    <p>Windows File Structure: Logical Drives and Cabinet Drawers Based on the file cabinet scenario, each cabinet drawer is represented as a logical drive on a Windows computer. For example, the logical drive "C:" is usually where your personal and system data is stored. The "D:" drive may contain files used for computer recovery that should only be managed by a system administrator.<p>
    <h2>macOS<h2\>
    <p>has multiple users but has issues with most programs unless they were made specifically for macOS it comes pre installed with terminal as its command prompt and its default web browser is safari as well primarily macOS only runs on apple made products however there is a group that makes “hackintosh” custom built computers with macOS loaded on these are for the productivity usage of macOS software and the power of a windows PC<p\>
    <p>macOS File Structure: macOS has a file management system with all the available storage split into parts that different parts of the computer can access this allows all applications to have their own file space to manage and operate within and not allowing them to access outside files as well the user has little access to files on the computer<p\>
